# Web tests with Serenity and Cucumber 4

### The project directory structure
The project has build scripts for Gradle, and follows the standard directory structure used in most Serenity projects:

```Gherkin
src
  + main
  + test
    + java                          Test runners and supporting code
    + resources
      + features                    Feature files
        + user                      Feature file subdirectoriesâ€¨
          user_login.feature  
          user_register.feature  
      + webdriver                   Bundled webdriver binaries
        + linux
        + mac
        + windows
          chromedriver.exe          OS-specific Webdriver binaries
          geckodriver.exe

```

## Executing the tests
To run the sample project, you can either just run the `CucumberTestSuite` test runner class, or run `gradle test` from the command line.

By default, the tests will run using Chrome. You can run them in Firefox by overriding the `driver` system property, e.g.
```json
$ gradle clean test -Pdriver=firefox
```

The test results will be recorded in the `target/site/serenity` directory.

## Simplified WebDriver configuration and other Serenity extras
The sample projects both use some Serenity features which make configuring the tests easier. In particular, Serenity uses the `serenity.conf` file in the `src/test/resources` directory to configure test execution options.  
### Webdriver configuration
The WebDriver configuration is managed entirely from this file, as illustrated below:
```java
webdriver {
    driver = chrome
}
headless.mode = true

chrome.switches="""--start-maximized;--test-type;--no-sandbox;--ignore-certificate-errors;
                   --disable-popup-blocking;--disable-default-apps;--disable-extensions-file-access-check;
                   --incognito;--disable-infobars,--disable-gpu"""

```

The project also bundles some of the WebDriver binaries that you need to run Selenium tests in the `src/test/resources/webdriver` directories. These binaries are configured in the `drivers` section of the `serenity.conf` config file:
```json
drivers {
  windows {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/windows/chromedriver.exe"
    webdriver.gecko.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/windows/geckodriver.exe"
  }
  mac {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/mac/chromedriver"
    webdriver.gecko.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/mac/geckodriver"
  }
  linux {
    webdriver.chrome.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/linux/chromedriver"
    webdriver.gecko.driver = "src/test/resources/webdriver/linux/geckodriver"
  }
}
```
This configuration means that development machines and build servers do not need to have a particular version of the WebDriver drivers installed for the tests to run correctly.

### Environment-specific configurations
We can also configure environment-specific properties and options, so that the tests can be run in different environments. Here, we configure three environments, __dev__, _staging_ and _prod_, with different starting URLs for each:
```json
environments {
  default {
    webdriver.base.url = "http://173.249.59.193:9125"
  }
  dev {
    webdriver.base.url = "http://173.249.59.193:9125"
  }
  staging {
    webdriver.base.url = "http://173.212.212.137:5125"
  }
  prod {
    webdriver.base.url = "http://173.212.212.137:5125"
  }
    all {
        home.page = "#{webdriver.base.url}"
        register.page = "#{webdriver.base.url}/uye-ol"
        login.page = "#{webdriver.base.url}/giris-yap"
    }
}
```
  
You use the `environment` system property to determine which environment to run against. For example to run the tests in the staging environment, you could run:
```json
$ gradle clean test -Denvironment=staging
```
